- Operationalize Solutions: Turn MVPs into stable, monitored systems with observability, fallback handling, and documentation.
- System Integration: Seamlessly connect AI workflows to tools such as HubSpot, Salesforce, Notion, GitHub, Jira, Slack, internal APIs, and more.
- Troubleshooting & Optimization: Continuously improve solution quality—debug failures, refine prompts and logic, and ensure high reliability.
- Enablement & Documentation: Deliver internal documentation, reusable templates, and hands-on support to drive team adoption and responsible usage.
- Quantify Impact: Track business value metrics such as time saved, error reduction, and improved cycle times.

What You Will Bring:
- 3–5 years of experience in automation, ops engineering, internal tooling, or technical enablement roles
- Strong Python and SQL skills
- Proficiency with no-code/low-code tools (e.g., Zapier, Make, Airtable)
- Experience working with LLMs and frameworks such as OpenAI, Claude, LangChain, or similar
- Ability to work cross-functionally and translate business needs into practical technical solutions.

Bonus if you have:
- Experience with REST APIs, webhooks, and system integrations
- Familiarity with internal tooling needs of engineering and product teams (e.g., Jira workflows, GitHub automations)
- Understanding of AI governance, data privacy, and fallback/responsibility frameworks
- Strong written and verbal communication skills with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
- Experience developing internal documentation and onboarding materials


You Will Get:
- High-impact ownership across departments and direct access to users
- Autonomy to drive initiatives from idea to implementation
- Hybrid work model: 3 days/week in our vibrant Tel Aviv HQ (Tue–Thu), rest remote
- Stock options—you grow with us
- Supportive, fast-moving leadership and meaningful learning opportunities
- Collaborative, diverse, and fun company culture
