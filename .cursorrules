# AI Resume System - Development Rules

## Project Guidelines

- Follow the PROJECT_PLAN.md for implementation phases
- Update PROGRESS_TRACKING.md as tasks are completed
- Maintain clean, well-documented code
- Focus on core functionality before adding advanced features

## Technical Requirements

- Use Python 3.10 for all Python commands and scripts
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Follow PEP 8 coding standards
- Use type hints where appropriate

## UI Design Requirements

- Create a clean and modern interface
- Minimize text content - use concise marketing phrases only
- Incorporate the Stampli logo from stampli.png
- Use and incorporate the gradient colors from the logo (light blue to purple to magenta/pink)
- Ensure responsive design for different screen sizes

## Code Organization

- Keep modules focused and single-purpose
- Use clear, descriptive function and variable names
- Add comprehensive docstrings for all functions
- Implement proper separation of concerns

## Security Considerations

- Implement prompt injection prevention
- Validate all user inputs
- Handle API keys securely
- Add rate limiting for API calls

## Performance Requirements

- Implement token counting for cost estimation
- Optimize API calls to minimize latency
- Add progress indicators for long-running operations
- Cache results where appropriate
- Add the actual cost from the LLM response to the outputs

## Testing Strategy

- Test each component individually
- Create sample data for testing
- Validate JSON output format
- Test error scenarios and edge cases

## Documentation

- Add extensive explanations for code changes
- Document new libraries and technologies used
- Include setup and usage instructions
- Maintain clear commit messages

## No Emojis Policy

- Do not use emojis anywhere in the codebase
- Keep communication professional and clear
- Use text-based indicators for status and progress

## Development Workflow

1. Start with core Python functionality
2. Test thoroughly before moving to UI
3. Integrate components incrementally
4. Update progress tracking after each major milestone
